Docker Image: A Docker Image is a read-only file with a bunch of instructions. When these instructions are executed, it creates a Docker container.
Dockerfile: Dockerfile is a simple text file that consists of instructions to build Docker images.
Dockerfile is a set of instructions that creates a stacked-layer for each instruction that collectively makes an image
