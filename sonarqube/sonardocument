pre-requisite:
    Hardware requirments: 3GB RAM, Disk space depending on project
        Linux: vm.max_map_count <= 524288
                    sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=524288
               fs.file-max >= 131072  --> sysctl fs.file-max
                            sysctl -w fs.file-max=131072
               at least 131072 file descriptors ---> ulimit -n
                                ulimit -n 131072
               open at least 8192 threads ---> ulimit -u
                                ulimit -u value
    To set this values permanently u need to set into 
        /etc/sysctl.d/99-sonarqube.conf /etc/sysctl.conf

Sonar installation:
    1. Install database create user and DB and give read or full permissions
    2. Download files from sonarqube official website and unzip
    3. change database settings in sonar.properties
    4. Start a sonarqube

Upgrade a sonar:

Troubleshooting
    Checking the logs:
        You'll find them in <SONARQUBE_HOME>/logs
        1. sonar.log: Log for the main process. Holds general information about startup and shutdown. You'll get overall status here but not details.
        2. web.log: Information about initial connection to the database, database migration and reindexing, and the processing of HTTP requests.
        3. ce.log: Information about background task processing and the database and search engine logs related to those tasks.
        4. es.log: Ops information from the search engine, such as Elasticsearch startup, health status changes

Jenkins extension for SonarQube
    1. sonarscanner
    2. sonarscanner for maven
    3. sonarscanner for gradle

you need to use third-party tool
